__Note__: This R package is not mean to be "serious". It's just for teaching purposes. 

# `WZZ`

This is an R package that gives `sqrt()` friends by providing other power functions.

## Example

See the vignette for more extensive use, but here's an example:

```{r example}
WZZ::square(2)
```

## For Developers

(Again, I don't actually intend for anyone to develop this silly package, but if I did, here's what I'd write.)

Use the internal `pow` function as the machinery for the front-end functions such as `square`, `cube`, and `reciprocal`.
